# Trading-strategy-backtest-project
#### Here I have project which backtest bitcoin trading strategy. The concept is simple buy low and sell high strategy. Signals are generated using average of previous candle range. The timeframe used is 5 minutes, but data from higher timeframes also could be tested.  The backtest function is not perfect as it simulates perfect trading conditions without trading fees, but it is great start for future trading strategy modeling and testing.
